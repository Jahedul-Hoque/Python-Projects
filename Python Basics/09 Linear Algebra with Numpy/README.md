# 📊 NumPy Matrix Operations 🚀

</div>

## 📖 Overview
This project demonstrates **NumPy matrix operations** commonly used in **financial computing, data science, and quantitative finance**. It covers **matrix creation, multiplication, and determinant calculations**.

## 🔑 Key Features
- **Creating predefined matrices** (ones, full, identity).
- **Performing matrix multiplication (`np.matmul()`).**
- **Computing determinants (`np.linalg.det()`).**

## 💻 Code Breakdown
```python
import numpy as np

# Creating a matrix of ones (2x3)
a = np.ones((2,3))
print(a, "\n")

# Creating a matrix filled with 5s (3x2)
b = np.full((3,2), 5)
print(b, "\n")

# Performing matrix multiplication
print(np.matmul(a, b), "\n")
# Explanation:
# - Matrix "a" (2x3) is multiplied by matrix "b" (3x2)
# - The result is a (2x2) matrix where each element is the sum of row-column multiplications.

# Creating an identity matrix (3x3) and calculating its determinant
c = np.identity(3)
print(np.linalg.det(c), "\n")
# The determinant of an identity matrix is always 1.
```

## 🔍 Explanation
1. **Matrix Creation (`np.ones()`, `np.full()`, `np.identity()`)**
   - `np.ones((2,3))` creates a **2x3 matrix of ones**.
   - `np.full((3,2), 5)` creates a **3x2 matrix filled with 5s**.
   - `np.identity(3)` generates a **3x3 identity matrix**.

2. **Matrix Multiplication (`np.matmul(a, b)`)**
   - **Row-by-column multiplication** to produce a **2x2 result matrix**.
   - Uses **linear algebra operations** for **efficient computation**.

3. **Determinant Calculation (`np.linalg.det()`)**
   - Determines the **scalability and invertibility** of a matrix.
   - The determinant of an identity matrix is **always 1**.

## 🚀 Why Use NumPy for Matrix Operations?
✅ **Optimized for performance** – Faster than nested Python lists.  
✅ **Efficient matrix manipulations** – Used in finance, machine learning, and data science.  
✅ **Simplifies complex calculations** – Eliminates the need for manual loops.  
✅ **Essential for quantitative finance** – Used in portfolio optimization and risk modeling.  

## 🔥 Future Enhancements
- ✅ Implement **matrix inversion (`np.linalg.inv()`)**.
- ✅ Compare **NumPy vs raw Python performance** using `timeit`.
- ✅ Explore **eigenvalues and eigenvectors (`np.linalg.eig()`)**.

## 🎯 Summary
This **NumPy matrix operations project** introduces fundamental matrix manipulations such as **multiplication and determinant calculations**. These techniques are crucial in **financial modeling, risk assessment, and quantitative analysis**.
